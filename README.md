Powershell Scripts

A simple powershell script that maps a letter to a drive for Google Drive File Stream. This can be uploaded via MDM software and deployed as a policy/product to machines. I have tested that functionality specifically in VMWare Workspace ONE (AirWatch). 



Tested and working on Windows 10.
